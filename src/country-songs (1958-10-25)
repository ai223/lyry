Ray Price - City Lights Lyrics

A bright array of city lights as far as I can see.
The great white way shines through the night for lonely guys like me.
The cabaretes and honky tonks their flashing signs invite,
A broken heart to lose itself in the glow of city lights.

Lights that say forget her name in a glass of cherry wine.
Lights that offer other girls for empty hearts like mine.
They paint a pretty picture of a world that's gay and bright,
But it's just a mask for loneliness behind those city lights.

The world was dark and God made stars to brighten up the night,
But I don't believe that God above, made those city lights,
Or it's just a place for men to cry when things don't turn out right,
Just a place to run away and hide behind those city lights.

Lights that say forget her love in a different athmosphere,
Lights that lure are nothing but a masquarade for tears,
They paint a pretty picture of a world that's gay and bright,
But I just can't say I love you to a street of city lights.

Faron Young - Alone With You Lyrics

(Roy Drusky - Lester Vanadore - Faron Young)

How I'd love to be around you
When the lonely night surrounds you
How I'd love to be alone with you

What I'd give to have the power
To read your mind one hour
How I'd love to be alone with you.

Just to be with you one night
You and me alone
Kiss your lips and hold you tight
Have you for my own.

This would be a joy unending
Could be a real beginning
How I'd love to be alone with you.

--- Instrumental ---

How I'd love to be around you
When the lonely night surrounds you
How I'd love to be alone with you.

If I only knew for certain
I'd cut out all my flirtin'
How I'd love to be alone with you.

Just to be with you one night
You and me alone
Kiss your lips and hold you tight
Have you for my own.

Won't you try to be my baby
Just for once and then well maybe
I could always be alone with you.

Won't you try to be my baby
Just for once and then well maybe
I could always be alone with you.
and I could always be alone with you...

Hank Thompson - Squaws Along The Yukon Lyrics

There's a salmon colored girl who sets my heart a whirl
Who lives along the Yukon far away
Where the northern lights they shine she rubs her nose to mine
She cuddles close and I can hear her say

Ooga ooga mooska, which means that I love you
If you'll be my baby, I'll ooga ooga mooska you
Then I take her hand in mine and set her on my knee
The squaws along the Yukon are good enough for me

She makes her underwear from hides of grizzly bear
And bathes in ice cold water every day
Her skin I love to touch but I just can't touch it much
Because her fur lined parka's in the way

Ooga ooga mooska, which means that I love you
If you'll be my baby, I'll ooga ooga mooska you
Then I take her hand in mine and set her on my knee
The squaws along the Yukon are good enough for me

She has the air corps down the sourdoughs hang around
Chechakos try to date her night and day
With a landing gear that's fine and a fuselage divine
And a smile that you can see a mile away

Ooga ooga mooska, which means that I love you
If you'll be my baby, I'll ooga ooga mooska you
Then I take her hand in mine and set her on my knee
The squaws along the Yukon are good enough for me

Carry me back to old Alaska
The squaws along the Yukon are good enough for me

Johnny Cash - All Over Again Lyrics

Every time I look at you I fall in love, all over again
Every time I think of you it all begins, all over again

One little dream at night and I can dream all day
It only takes a memory to thrill me
One little kiss from you and I just fly away
Pour me out your love until you fill me

I wanna fall in love beginning from the start, all over again
Show me how you stole away my heart, all over again

One little dream at night and I can dream all day
It only takes a memory to thrill me
One little kiss from you and I just fly away
Pour me out your love until you fill me

I wanna fall in love beginning from the start, all over again
Show me how you stole away my heart, all over again

All over again, All over again, All over again, All over again
All Over Again

Ernest Tubb - Half A Mind Lyrics

I don't love you like I used to do
But I'm afraid to tell you so
I've got half a mind to leave you
But only half the heart to go

Words to tell you just don't come to me
Guess my courage is too slow
I've got half a mind to leave you
But only half the heart to go

Now time may prove that you're not to blame
But now's the time I need to know
I've got half a mind to leave you
But only half the heart to go

Johnny Horton - All Grown Up Lyrics

Hey daddy, hey daddy I'm all grown up

Standing at your door just like I done before
You've changed so strange you're all grown up

You wear those heels and hose dressed up in your mama's clothes
You're hip, I'm whipped, your all grown up

When I'm walking talking to ya all the time
Makes me wet all over honey so glad your mine

When you feel my touch by loving you too much
You're right, so nice, you're all grown up

Hey daddy, hey daddy I'm all grown up

You threw away those candy bars started gazing at the stars
Brand new that's you you're all grown up

When your lips so fine start closing in on mine
More thrills, more chills you're all grown up

When I'm walking talking to ya all the time
Makes me wet all over honey so glad your mine

When you feel my touch by loving you too much
You're right, so nice, you're all grown up

Hey daddy, hey daddy I'm all grown up

Johnny Cash - What Do I Care Lyrics

When I'm all through if I haven't been what they think I should be
If the total isn't high enough when they figure me
When I grow old if there's no gray from worry in my hair
What do I care? What do I care?

What do I care just as long as you were mine a little while?
When the road was long and weary you gave me a few good mile
What do I care if I miss a goal because I make a slip?
I'll still be satisfied because I tasted your sweet lips

What do I care if I never have much money?
And sometimes my table looks a little bare
Anything that I may miss is made up for each time we kiss
You love me and I love you, so what do I care?

What do I care just as long as you were mine a little while?
When the road was long and weary you gave me a few good mile
What do I care if I miss a goal because I make a slip?
I'll still be satisfied because I tasted your sweet lips

What do I care if I never have much money?
And sometimes my table looks a little bare
Anything that I may miss is made up for each time we kiss
You love me and I love you, so what do I care?

Ray Price - Invitation To The Blues Lyrics

(Roger Miller)

I couldn't sleep last night just walked the floor
Don't know how I stand this anymore
Lonely are the times since I lost you
Recieved your invitation to the blues.

I don't know why you caused me such pain
I just hope I'll never go through this much again
Thanks for sending something I can't use
Recieved your invitation to the blues.

--- Instrumental ---

You took the laughter from this world of mine
Thanks to you the sun will never shine
Walk the floor so much wore out my shoes
Recieved your invitation to the blues.

I don't know why, I don't know why you caused me such pain
I just hope I'll never go through this much again
Lonely me, I don't know what to do
Recieved your invitation to the blues...

Kitty Wells - Touch And Go Heart Lyrics

Touch and go that's how your love is first you're mine and then we're apart

Even though I know what your game is I still cling to your touch and go heart

You only want my company when you are feeling blue

Just when I think you care a little there's someone new

Though I know how hopeless my chance is I'm just a slave for your touch and go heart

[ steel - fiddle ]

Touch and go that's how...

Kitty Wells - Jealousy Lyrics

Oh how wrong can you be?
Oh to fall in love was my very first mistake
How was I to know I was far too much in love to see?
Oh jealousy look at me now
Jealousy you got me somehow
You gave me no warning
Took me by surprise
Jealousy you led me on
You couldn't lose you couldn't fail
You had suspicion on my trail

How how how all my jealousy
I wasn't man enough to let you hurt my pride
Now I'm only left with my own jealousy

Oh how strong can you be
With matters of the heart?
Life is much too short
To while away with tears
If only you could see just what you do to me
Oh jealousy you tripped me up
Jealousy you brought me down
You bring me sorrow you cause me pain
Jealousy when will you let go?
Gotta hold of my possessive mind
Turned me into a jealous kind

How how how all my jealousy
I wasn't man enough to let you hurt my pride
Now I'm only left with my own jealousy
But now it matters not if I should live or die
'cause I'm only left with my own jealousy

Yes, I keep falling back to you
What else can I do
I keep falling back to you

So many times, I've had you on my mind

Yes, I keep falling back to you

I keep falling back to you

Don Gibson - Blue Blue Day Lyrics

It's been a blue, blue day
I feel like runnin' away
I feel like runnin' away from it all

My love has been untrue
She's found somebody new
It's been a blue, blue day for me

I feel like cryin', dyin'
What can I do
Feel like prayin', sayin'
I'm glad we're through

It's been a blue, blue day
I feel like runnin' away
I feel like runnin' away from the blues

I cannot make believe
That I don't sit and grieve
It's been a blue, blue day for me

I can't pretend and say
That I don't love her anyway
It's been a blue, blue day for me

I feel like cryin', dyin'
What can I do
Feel like prayin', sayin'
I'm glad we're through

It's been a blue, blue day
I feel like runnin' away
I feel like runnin' away from the blues
I feel like runnin' away from the blues
