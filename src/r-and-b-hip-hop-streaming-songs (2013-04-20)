Drake - Started From The Bottom Lyrics

Started...
(Zombie on the track)

Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team fuckin' here
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now the whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now the whole team fuckin' here

I done kept it real from the jump
Livin' at my momma's house we'd argue every month
Nigga, I was tryna get it on my own
Workin' all night, traffic on the way home
And my uncle callin' me like, "Where ya at?
I gave you the keys told ya bring it right back"
Nigga, I just think it's funny how it goes
Now I'm on the road, half a million for a show

and we...

Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team fuckin' here
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now the whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now the whole team fuckin' here
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now the whole team here, nigga

Boys tell stories 'bout the man
Say I never struggled, wasn't hungry, yeah, I doubt it
Nigga, I could turn your boy into the man
There ain't really much out here that's poppin' off without us
Nigga, we just want the credit where it's due
I'ma worry 'bout me, give a fuck about you
Nigga, just as a reminder to myself
I wear every single chain, even when I'm in the house, cause we...

Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team fuckin' here
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now the whole team here, nigga

No new niggas, nigga we don't feel that
Fuck a fake friend, where your real friends at?
We don't like to do too much explainin'
Story stayed the same, I never changed it
No new niggas, nigga we don't feel that
Fuck a fake friend, where you real friends at?
We don't like to do too much explainin'
Story stayed the same through the money and the fame cause we...

Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team fuckin' here
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now the whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now the whole team here, nigga

Lil Wayne - Love Me Lyrics

I'm on that good kush and alcohol
I got some down bitches I can call
I don't know what I would do without y'all
I'm gon' ball til the day I fall

Yeah, long as my bitches love me (yeah, yeah)
I can give a fuck 'bout no hater
Long as my bitches love me (yeah, yeah)
I can give a fuck 'bout no niggas
Long as these bitches love me

Uh, pussy ass nigga stop hating
Lil Tunechi got that fire
And these ho's love me like Satan, maaaan!
Fuck with me and get bodied
And all she eat is dick
She's on a strict diet, that's my baby
With no makeup she a ten
And she the best with that head
Even better then Karrine
She don't want money
She want the time that we could spend
She said "Cause I really need somebody
So tell me you're that somebody"
Girl, I fuck who I want and fuck who I don't
Got that A1 credit, that's that filet mignon
She said "I never want to make you mad
I just want to make you proud"
I said "Baby just make me cum
Then don't make no sound"

I'm on that good kush and alcohol
I got some down bitches I can call
I don't know what I would do without y'all
I'm gon' ball til the day I fall

Yeah, long as my bitches love me (yeah, yeah)
I can give a fuck 'bout no hater
Long as my bitches love me
I can give a fuck 'bout no niggas
Long as these bitches love me

Real nigga fuck these haters
These hoes got pussies like craters
Can't treat these hoes like ladies, man!
Pussy, money, weed, codeine
She said my dick feel like morphine
I hope my name taste like sardines to these niggas
She wake up, eat this dick, call that breakfast in bed
69, 96, I feel her heartbeat
I chest to chest with this bitch
Now turn around, face down, I'm arrestin' this bitch
All my bitches love me and I love all my bitches
But its like as soon as I cum, I come to my senses
And I would say these hoes name
But then I would be snitching
And these haters try to knock me
But they can't knock me off the hinges

I'm on that good kush and alcohol
I got some down bitches I can call
I don't know what I would do without y'all
I'm gon' ball til the day I fall

Yeah, long as my bitches love me (yeah, yeah)
I can give a fuck 'bout no hater
Long as my bitches love me
I can give a fuck 'bout

I lost a few good bitches
Met some more bad bitches
I be schooling them niggas
Pose for your class picture
Now kiss my ass if you hating
I'm getting ass while I'm skating

I lost a few good bitches
Met some more bad bitches
I be schooling them niggas
Pose for your class picture
Now kiss my ass if you hating
I'm getting ass while I'm skating

I'm on that good kush and alcohol
I got some down bitches I can call
I don't know what I would do without y'all

Yeah, long as my bitches love me (yeah, yeah)
I can give a fuck 'bout no hater
Long as my bitches love me
I can give a fuck 'bout no niggas
Long as these bitches love me

Wale - Bad Lyrics

Is it bad that I never made love, no I never did it
...
But I sure know how to fuck
I'll be your bad girl, I'll prove it to you
I can't promise that I'll be good to you

Cause I had some issues, I won't commit
...
No, not having it
But at least I can admit that I'll be bad noooooo to you (to you)
...
Yeah, I'll be good in bed but I'll be bad to you
Bad that I never made love, no I never did it
...
But I sure know how to fuck ya, I be

Yeah hold up, bad girls ain't no good, and the good girls ain't no fun

Look (And the bad girls want a real nigga)
Yeah, cause real niggas just want (ha)
So it seems that we caught up in the wrong thing
Got a thing for a queen who don't wanna leave
You got a (thing for a king, but you ain't a king)
Seems like the ones who roll never got a ring
And I can see that you're (bad, no to you)
Yeah in the literal sense, I mean physical sense
I mean the, oops, wait, let me give me a second
I need a minute to vent, I'm only telling that
I heard you (bad girl)
And I'm tellin' you I could believe that
Not the type of fella to yell or be gettin' jealous
But we talkin' 'bout game, Wale got league pass
We at that bed, floor, couch, hold up
(Loud, pack, boy, roll up)
You know what's up? (What's up)
Forget it, 'cause you know the bad girls always unapologetic

Is it bad that, I never made love, no I never did it
...

But I sure know how to fuck I'll be your
Bad girl, I'll prove it to you
Can't promise that, I'll be good to you
Cause I had some issues, I won't commit, no not having it
...
But at least i can admit that I'll be bad no to you (to you)
...

She hurt feeling, she ain't wrong
...
She work hard, she play harder

Got a smart mouth, like a speed fly
She don't catch feeling she too busy catching G5
She no saint, 'cept Saint Laurent
Gone blaze up, take the wheel Jah
And Rihanna got these women in they River's Island
I'm just tryin' to take a dip ya
Never did terrible bullshit ya
Enough with the concerns, she try and live it up
No more sucker for love, she probably duck it because
You try to follow your gut feeling you get lost
(Cause I've had some issues)
Yeah and I noticed it
You got the coldest corazon, but warmer skin
You froze with it, you try and play Sub Zero i be Scorpion
Psh get over here today
Smellin' like Jean Paul, got the ye
Got about three friends, she don't even tweet them
Ain't no IG, but she follow K
And we at that bed, floor, couch, hold up

(Loud, pack, boy, roll up)
You know what's up? (What's up?)
Forget it, all these bad bitches always unapologetic
Is it bad that, I never made love, no I never did it
...
But I sure know how to fuck I'll be your
Bad girl, I'll prove it to you
'Cause I had some issues, I won't commit, no not having it
...
But at least I can admit that I'll be bad no to you (to you)
...
Yeah, I'll be good in bed, but I'll be bad to you (bad to you)

J. Cole - Power Trip Lyrics

""
Got me up all night, all I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night, constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night, down and out with these love songs
She got me up all night, drownin' out with these love songs
She got me up all night, all I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night, constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night, down and out with these love songs
She got me open all night, got me open all night

""
Okay, back when I was sleepin' in my mama's crib
Even back then when I was up there in my mother's crib
Payin' seventeen-hundred for the rent, money well spent
No heater, but a nigga made heat, may I vent
Had a thing for you, even wrote the song dreams for you
Cause I had dreams for you, thoughts of a ring for you
Childish shit, you know childish shit
Anonymous flowers sent, you know coward shit
Now a nigga signed to Hov, took a power trip
Back home I'm grown now and this city's my throne now
The same clubs I used to get tossed out
Life got crisscrossed, totally crossed out
Cause now I'm in this bitch and I'm totally bossed out
Old chicks cryin' cause they know that they lost out
But I'm still on you, I'm still on you
My drink spilled on me, while I feel on you
I'm saying...

""
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want you to want me
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want ya

And we are we are we are
Got me up all night
And we are we are we are
All I'm singin' is love songs
And we are we are we are
Got me up all night
And we are we are we are
She got me
And we are we are we are
She got me

""
Well this has gotta be the longest crush ever
If I ever get to fuck it'd be the longest bust ever
Love is a drug, like the strongest stuff ever
And, fuck it I'm on one, you feel me?
She on a power trip, she got me where she want a nigga
Wifin' in the club, man my homies' gon' disown a nigga
Like, give me 20 dolla, dolla
Ass stupid, how you get to college, college
I'm in your city and I'm wonderin' if you're home now
Went and found a man, but I'm hopin' you alone now
Can't help but feelin' like I dropped the ball, cliche
I used to pop up on you at the mall each day
Now typically I kick game like Eastbay
But you got a nigga freeze-framed yellin', "Please play!"
For pete's sake, homie pull it together
Just fuck her one time and be through it forever
But...

Ace Hood - Bugatti Lyrics

(Super, Future)

I come looking for you with Haitians
I stay smoking on good Jamaican
I fuck bitches from different races
You get money they started hating

I woke up in a new Bugatti
I woke up in a new Bugatti
I woke up in a new Bugatti
I woke up in a new Bugatti

I woke up in a new Bugatti

Niggas be hatin I'm rich as a bitch
100 K I spent that on my wrist
Two hundred thousand I spent that on your bitch
Do me a model, put that on my list
Oh there he go in that foreign again
Killin the scene bring the coroner in
Murder she wrote, swallow or choke
Hit her and go, I won't call her again
Woke up early morning, crib as big as a college
Smoke me a pound of the loudest
Whippin some shit with no mileage
Diamonds cost me a fortune

Them horses all in them Porsches
You pussies can't hardly afford it

4, 200 my mortgage
Ballin on niggas like Kobe
Fuck all you haters you bore me
Only the real get a piece of the plate
Reppin my city I'm runnin my state
Give me a pistol then run with the K's
Niggas want beef then I visit ya place Bang!
I come looking for you with Haitians
I stay smoking on good Jamaican
I fuck bitches from different races
You get money they started hating
I woke up in a new Bugatti
I woke up in a new Bugatti
I woke up in a new Bugatti

I woke up in a new Bugatti
I woke up in a new Bugatti
Yeah, and I'm at it again

There go that flow bringin tragedy in
Copped me a chain your salary spent
Niggas is sweet bring them cavities in
Countin money, hourly trend
Rolling them skinny like Olsen twins
Niggas is squares, cabin and pens
Neck full of Gold Olympian shit
Neimans, I'm blowing the check on they gear
Fall on some pussy then hop on the Lear
Shot with them choppers back of the rear
Sak pase' them killers is here
Woke up early morning, mind is tellin me money
Paper, mula, pockets is fat as a tumor
Billionaire nigga no rumor
Livin my life off of tuna
Wanted with me I deliver the beef
Real niggas only enjoyin the feast
Pull up a seat, bon appetite
No Louboutins put that red on your feet Bang

I come looking for you with Haitians
I stay smoking on good Jamaican
I fuck bitches from different races
You get money they started hating

I woke up in a new Bugatti
I woke up in a new Bugatti
I woke up in a new Bugatti
I woke up in a new Bugatti
I woke up in a new Bugatti
Photographs of dope boys, is all they taking
Finger prints on the Rolls Royce, is why they hatin'
Push a button on these broke boys, that's detonation

Walk a road to riches bare feet
I watch mama struggle now she livin' carefree
That's why I hustle for half a key that's 12 G's

I'm tryin' to bubble every summer a new LP
You gotta love me I got shooters out the D-League

Signin' bonus hit that man that's from thirty feet
Left in a puddle, finger prints is on hundred mill
And what it is?

Ricky Rozay and Ace Hood, we hella Trill
Yeah

I come looking for you with Haitians
I stay smoking on good Jamaican
I fuck bitches from different races
You get money they started hating
I woke up in a new Bugatti
I woke up in a new Bugatti
I woke up in a new Bugatti
I woke up in a new Bugatti
I woke up in a new Bugatti

Alicia Keys - Girl On Fire Lyrics

She's just a girl and she's on fire

Hotter than a fantasy, lonely like a highway
She's living in a world and it's on fire
Feeling with catastrophe, but she knows she can fly away
Ohhhh oh oh oh oh

She got both feet on the ground
And she's burning it down
Ohhhh oh oh oh oh
She got her head in the clouds
And she's not backing down
This girl is on fire

This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire
This girl is on fire
Looks like a girl, but she's a flame

So bright, she can burn your eyes
Better look the other way
You can try but you'll never forget her name
She's on top of the world
Hottest of the hottest girls say
Ohhhh oh oh oh

We got our feet on the ground
And we're burning it down
Ohhhh oh oh oh oh
Got our head in the clouds
And we're not coming down
This girl is on fire (fire, fire)

This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire (fire, fire)
This girl is on fire
Everybody stares, as she goes by

'Cause they can see the flame that's in her eyes
Watch her when she's lighting up the night
Nobody knows that she's a lonely girl
And it's a lonely world
But she gon' let it burn, baby, burn, baby
This girl is on fire (fire, fire)
This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire (fire, fire)
This girl is on fire
Oh, oh, oh, oh ohhhhh oh oh oh ohhh oh oh oh ohhhh...
Oh, oh, oh, oh ohhhhh oh oh oh ohhh oh oh oh ohhhh...
Oh, oh, oh, oh ohhhhh oh oh oh ohhh oh oh oh ohhhh...
Oh, oh, oh, oh ohhhhh oh oh oh ohhh oh oh oh ohhhh...
She's just a girl and she's on fire

Lil Wayne - Rich As F**k Lyrics

Never talk to the cops, I don't speak pig Latin
I turn the penny to a motherfucking Janet Jackson
Tell the bitches that be hatin' I ain't got no worries
I just wanna hit and run like I ain't got insurances
Hoe whats yo name whats yo sign, Zodiac Killer
All rats gotta die, even Master Splinter
Yeah Murder 187
I be killing them bitches I hope all dogs go to heaven
And I got Xanax, percocet, promethazine with codeine
Call me Mr Sandman, I'm selling all these hoes dreams
Got a white girl with big titties, flat ass TV screen
I keep a bad bitch call me the BB King
You know I got that mouth out her
And put that bitch out like a house fire
I'm killing these hoes like Michael Myers
I eat that cat just like a lion
And I can't trust none of these niggas

Can't trust none of these hoes
I see your girl when I want, I got that ho TiVo'd
Got a red ass bitch with a red ass pussy
Nigga try me, that a dead ass pussy

Cuz y'all motherfuckers so blind to the fact

To tell you the truth, I don't care who's looking
All I know is I love my bitch
That pussy feel just like heaven on earth

Six feet deep, dick shovel in dirt
R.I.P.-Rest in pussy

Light that shit then pass that shit
We gon' get so smoked out
And then I went got locked up

Every night I dreamt I broke out
One Time for them pussy niggas
That's that shit I don't like
We eating over here nigga
Fuck around and have food fight
And that's 2 Chainz.
Look at you
Now look at us
All my niggas look rich as fuck
All my niggas look rich as fuck
All my niggas look rich as fuck
Look at you
Now look at us
All my niggas look rich as fuck
All my niggas look rich as fuck

All my niggas look rich as fuck

AK on my night stand, right next to the bible
But I swear with these 50 shots, I'll shoot it out with 5-0
Pockets gettin too fat, no weight watchers no lipo

Money talks, bullshit walks on a motherfucking tight rope

And I make that pussy tap out, I knock that pussy out cold
Nigga you get beat the crap out but that's just how the dice roll
These hoes want that hose pipe, so I give all these hoes pipe
She get on that dick and stay on, all night like porch lights
Lets do it, fuck talking, we out here we ballin
And I'm spraying that on these rusty niggas like WD40
We fucked up, we Truk'd up, no if ands or but fucks

Bitch niggas go behind yo back like nun-chucks and that's fucked up
But my hoes down, my cups up, my niggas down for whatever
These bitches think they're too fly well tell em hoes I pluck feathers
I'm Tunechi, Young Tunechi, I wear Trukfit fuck Gucci
She's blowing kisses at me with her pussy lips, smooches

And that's 2 Chainz...

Look at you

Rihanna - Diamonds Lyrics

Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond

Find light in the beautiful sea, I choose to be happy
You and I, you and I, we're like diamonds in the sky
You're a shooting star I see, a vision of ecstasy
When you hold me, I'm alive, we're like diamonds in the sky

I knew that we'd become one right away, oh, right away
At first sight I felt the energy of sun rays
I saw the life inside your eyes

So shine bright tonight, you and I
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye, so alive
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Shine bright like a diamond (Whoa-oh)
Shine bright like a diamond (Whoa-oh)
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Shine bright like a diamond (Whoa-oh)
Shine bright like a diamond (Whoa-oh)
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Palms rise to the universe, as we moonshine and molly
Feel the warmth, we'll never die, we're like diamonds in the sky
You're a shooting star I see, a vision of ecstasy
When you hold me, I'm alive, we're like diamonds in the sky

At first sight I felt the energy of sun rays
I saw the life inside your eyes

So shine bright tonight, you and I
Wewre beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye, so alive
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Shine bright like a diamond (Whoa-oh)
Shine bright like a diamond (Whoa-oh)
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Shine bright like a diamond (Whoa-oh)
Shine bright like a diamond (Whoa-oh)
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond

We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Kendrick Lamar - Poetic Justice Lyrics

Every second, every minute, man I swear that she can get it
Say if you a bad bitch put your hands up high, hands up high, hands up high
Tell 'em dim the lights down right now, put me in the mood
I'm talking 'bout dark room, perfume
Go, go!
I recognize your fragrance (hol' up!)
You ain't never gotta say shit (woo!)
And I know your taste is
A little bit (mmm) high maintenance (ooh)
Everybody else basic
You live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
I mean write poems in these songs dedicated to you
And you're in the mood for empathy, theres blood in my pen
Better yet when your friends and them
I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off
Fuck that, pour up plenty of champagne
Cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends and
Y'all curled in that little bitty range I heard that
She wanna go and party, She wanna go and party
Nigga don't approach her with that Atari
Nigga that ain't good game, homie, sorry
They say conversation, rule a nation, I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs
'less I write it down for real, P.S
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just know just know just know just know just
What you want, Poetic Justice, put it in a song
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just know just know just know just know just
What you want, Poetic Justice, put it in a song
I really hope you play this
Cause ol' girl you test my patience
With all these seductive photographs and all these one off vacations
You've been taken
Clearly a lot for me to take in
It don't make sense
Young East African Girl, you too busy fucking with your other man
I was trying to put you on game, put you on a plane
Take you and your mama to the motherland
I could do it, maybe one day
When you figure out you're gonna need someone
When you figure out it's all right here in the city
And you don't run from where we come from
That sound like Poetic Justice, Poetic Justice
You were so new to this life but God damn you got adjusted
I mean I write poems in these songs, dedicated to the fun sex
Your natural hair and your soft skin, and your big ass in that sundress (ooh!)
Good God, what you doing that walk for?
When I see that thing move, I just wish we would fight less and we would talk more
And they say communication saves relations, I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs unless I write them down for real
P.S...
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just know just know just know just know just
What you want, Poetic Justice, put it in a song
Every time I write these words they become a taboo
Making sure my punctuation curve
Every letter is true
Living my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof
I'm talking poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
I mean you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb, It's you looking in the mirror
Love is not just a verb, It's you looking poor maybe
Call me crazy, We can both be insane
A fatal attraction is common
And what we have common is pain
I mean you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb and I can see power steering
Sex drive when you swerve, I want that interference
It's coherent, I can hear it, mmhmm
That's your heartbeat
It either caught me or it called me, mmhmm
Breathe slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines
Sincerely, yours truly
And right before you go blind
P.S...
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just know just know just know just know just
What you want, Poetic Justice, put it in a song
"I'm gon' ask you one more time homie, where is you from? Or it is a problem"
"Ay you over here for Sherane homie?"
"Yo I don't care who this nigga over here for, if he don't tell where he come, it's a wrap! I'm sorry"
"Hol' up hol' up hol' up, we gon' do it like this, OK? I'mma tell you where I'm from, you gon' tell me where you from, OK? Or where your Grandma stay, where your mama stay, or where your daddy stay, OK?"
"Enough with all this talkin"
"Matter of fact, get out the van homie. Get out the car before I snatch you out that mother fucker homie"

Got fleezy in the back and chello in the front
Listen to the record boy I got what you wont
Beatz so fly cuz the club on chomp
Got hizz like woofs beatin in the back of the door
Ladies take it back throw back the joint
Bend at the waist, lean to the front
Now Bounce yo body to the, just a little bit harder
Shawty move yo feet just a little

Aint nobody here wop better than me
Purple flag to the left Who better than me.
I got an all star squad who better than me.
Man listening to the beat who better the me.

And then be weepin' way to long...

Wopping like they breakin' they backs (breakin they backs)
Takin' it: back, back, back... wait!

Hotta' than a baby in a microwave
Look at how she woppin' man she might get paid

Wop Wop Wop a little harder
Look at how she wop she a party starter
I hope that security remembered to card her
Cuz I never done the wop where you ain't hotter

Tell her if you give me your number then maybe I call her
She said that she knew me and know I'm a baller
Man I better wop outa here I'll see yall tomorrow.

I made a little bit of money (I made a little bit of money)

And if she make this dick hard, she woke up a sleeping giant
Man your bitch speak in tongues every time we speak in private
Hope your barber shop open cause we got hair triggers
Smoke so much that Smokey the Bear, have to bear with us
And that Jeep with the doors off that means that bitch sleek
All these bitch think they're the shit, I sent them up shits creek
You see Tunechi right here, give me brain ideas
It's ok if you turn up just don't turn off my light years
All I know is I do it what I'm smoking I grew it
These are Blood gang Piru, and all rats gotta die even Stewart
On my private jet is my stewardess is your bitch nigga, bitch nigga

You don't get dissed, you get disfigured
She say sorry I didn't shave so that pussy a little furry

You see pussy right there redbone mangos right there
See them sh-roomies right there we ain't got no worries

She want me to eat her sugar, I say "Why you in a hurry?"
She say "Why you asking questions?" I say "Bitch you trynna be funny!"
Now take your fucking clothes off, let me see that donkey kong
I swing your ass back and forth, back and forth on my monkey bars
That camel toe that camel toe, no worries no panty-hose
These niggas falling off like baggy clothes, I smoke more than a magic show

Nicki Minaj - High School Lyrics

He said he came from Jamaica
He owned a couple acres
A couple fake visas cause he never got his papers
Gave up on love, fucking with them heart breakers
But he was getting money with the movers and the shakers
He was mixed with a couple things
Ball like a couple rings
Bricks in the condo and grams to sing sing
Left arm, baby mother tatted
5-year bid up, North on they ratted
Anyway, I felt him, helped him
Put him on lock, seatbelt them
Took him out to Belgium, welcome!
Bitches this pretty, that's seldom
This box better than the box he was held in
I'm Momma Dee in that order
I call him Daddy like daughters

He like it when I get drunk
But I like it when he be sober
That's top of the toppa
I never fuck with beginners
I let him play with my pussy
Then lick it off of his fingers
I'm in the zone
They holler at me but its you
You, this ain't high school
Me and my crew, we can slide through

Give it to you whenever you want

Whip it whenever you want
Baby, it's yours anywhere, everywhere
Baby it's your world, ain't it?
Baby it's your world, ain't it?
She got a nigga at home and one on the side
Best friend is a dike, they fucked around a few times
Her and her momma alike, so all they do is fight
I tell her make me some money, she tell me make her a wife
I tell her: "bitch, you crazy, fück wrong with you?
And excuse my French, but I'm a long kisser
And then she try to tell me I'm the only one that's hitting
And I say: "what about them niggas?"
She say: "what about them niggas?"
You right, what you doing tonight?
Put on something tight

Don't judge me, I get life
She love me like a brother

But fuck me like a husband
Pussy like a oven too hot to put my tongue in
All I had to do is rub it
The genie out the bottle
Pussy so wet, I'm a need goggles
She tell me that's it's mine
I tell her stop lying, mine and who else?
She say worry about yourself, Lil Tune

They holler at me but its you
You, this ain't high school
Me and my crew, we can slide through

Give it to you whenever you want
Whip it whenever you want
Baby, it's yours anywhere, everywhere
Baby it's your world, ain't it?
Baby it's your world, ain't it?
I know you want it boy
I see you trying
Just keep on pushing
I'ma let you slide in
Just close your eyes and
This horizon
It's ready, come get you some
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Kendrick Lamar - Swimming Pools (Drank) Lyrics

Pour up (Drank) Head shot (Drank)
Sit down (Drank) Stand up (Drank)
Pass out (Drank) Wake up (Drank)
Faded (Drank) Faded (Drank)

Now I done grew up 'round some people livin' their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask, backstroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feels, some people wanna kill their sorrows
Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
I was in a dark room, loud tunes, looking to make a vow soon
That I'ma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup, I see the crowd mood
Changin' by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip then another sip, then somebody said to me:

Nigga, why you babysitting only two or three shots?
I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor, I'mma dive in it

Pour up (Drank) Head shot (Drank)
Sit down (Drank) Stand up (Drank)
Pass out (Drank) Wake up (Drank)
Faded (Drank) Faded (Drank)

Okay, now open your mind up and listen me, Kendrick
I am your conscience, if you do not hear me, then you will be history, Kendrick
I know that you're nauseous right now and I'm hopin' to lead you to victory, Kendrick
If I take another one down, I'ma drown in some poison, abusin' my limit
I think that I'm feelin' the vibe, I see the love in her eyes, I see the feelin'
The freedom is granted as soon as the damage of vodka arrived
This how you capitalize, this is parental advice
Then apparently I'm over influenced by what you are doin'
I thought I was doin' the most 'til someone said to me:

Nigga, why you babysitting only two or three shots?
I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor, I'mma dive in it

Pour up (Drank) Head shot (Drank)
Sit down (Drank) Stand up (Drank)
Pass out (Drank) Wake up (Drank)
Faded (Drank) Faded (Drank)

I ride, you ride, bang
One chopper, one hundred shots, bang
Hop out, do you bang?
Two chopper, two hundred shots, bang

Nigga, why you babysitting only two or three shots?
I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor, I'mma dive in it

Pour up (Drank) Head shot (Drank)
Sit down (Drank) Stand up (Drank)
Pass out (Drank) Wake up (Drank)
Faded (Drank) Faded (Drank)

(Sherane)

Aw man... where is she taking me...
Where is she taking me...

All I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got hunger, pain, that grow insane
Tell me, do that sound familiar?
If it do, then you're like me
Makin' excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom
Of a bottle
And the greenest indo leaf
As the window open I release everything that corrode inside of me
I see you jokin'
Why you laugh?
Don't you feel bad?
I probably sleep
And never ever wake up
Never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust, but just when I thought I had enough

They stomped the homie out over a bitch?
K-dot, you good, blood?
Now we can drop, ye we can drop you back off
That nigga's straight man, that nigga ain't tripping
We gon' do the same ol' shit
I'mma pop a few shots, they gon' run, they gon' run opposite ways
Fall right in ----'s lap
And he gon' tear they ass up, simple as that
And I hope that bitch that set him up out there, we gon' pop that bitch too
Wait hold up, aye I see somebody
(Car door opens and gunshots are fired)
Aha! Got them niggas, K-dot, you good?
L----, you good?
Yeah blood, I'm good, Dave, you good?
Dave? Dave, say something - Dave?
These bitch ass niggas killed my brother!

Rihanna - Pour It Up Lyrics

Throw it, throw it up
Watch it all fall out
Pour It Up, Pour It Up
That's how we ball out
Throw it, throw it up
Watch it all fall out
Pour It Up, Pour It Up

That's how we ball out
Strip clubs and dollar bills
I still got mo' money
Patron shots, can I get a refill
I still got mo' money

Strippers going up and down that pole

And I still got mo' money
Four o clock and we aint going home
Cause I still got mo' money
Money make the world go around

I still got mo' money
Bands make your girl go down

And I still got mo' money
Lot mo' where dat came from
I still got mo' money
I look in your eyes, I know you want some
And I still got mo' money

Ohhhh
All I see is signs
All I see is dollar signs

Ohhhhh
Money on my mind
Money, money on my mind
Throw it, throw it up

Watch it fall out from the sky
Throw it, throw it up
Watch it all fall out
Pour It Up, Pour It Up

That's how we ball out
Throw it, throw it up
Watch it all fall out
Pour It Up, Pour It Up
That's how we ball out
That's how we ball out
That's how we ball out
That's how we ball out
Valet cost a hundred bills
And I still got mo' money
Gold all up in my grill
I still got mo' money
Who cares how you haters feel
And I still got mo' money
Call Jay up and close the deal
'Cause I still got mo' money
My fragance on and they love my smell
I still got mo' money

So who cares about what I spend?
I still got mo' money
My pockets deep and they never end
And I still got mo' money
I'm going dumb with all my friends

And I still got mo' money
Ohhh all I see is signs

All I see is dollar signs
Ohhhhh money on my mind
Money, money on my mind
Throw it, throw it up
Watch it fall out from the sky
Throw it, throw it up

Short hair like Nia Long
Loose one she don't need a loan
She start twerking when she hear a song
The stripper pole her income
We get trippy and then some
So nasty when she rolling
She put that ass off in my hands
I remote control it
She give me dome when the roof gone
At the K.O.D. she leave with me
She got friends bring three
I got drugs I got drinks
Bend it over, Juicy J gone poke it like wet paint
You say no to ratchet pussy Juicy J can't
Racks everywhere, they're showing racks I'm throwing racks
In the VIP rubber on I'm stretching that
Rich niggas tipping
Broke niggas looking
And it ain't a strip club if they ain't showing pussy.

Pull out my black card, that's my lil' nigga
Make a movie with your bitch, Steven Spiel-nigga
Smokin' on Keysha, Cole give me chills nigga
What's your real name, and not your stripper name
I make it rain on ya, like a windowpane
Bands a make her dance, Tunechi make her cum
Hit it from the side like a motherfuckin' bass drum
Two hoes on one fuckin' pole
Two hoes on my fuckin' pole
I don't tip, I pay bills
Bitches call me Buffalo
Her stomach in, her ass out
I'm flyer than the ones they pass out
If money grow on trees, I branched out
I'm just waitin' for my bitch to cash out!

Bands a make her dance

If yo girl don't swallow kids, man that hoe basic
Got two bitches with me, take a shot of one hoe
Using her friend for a chaser
Bands a make her buss it, buss it
Let me see you touch it, touch it
Money talk you ain't got none, end of discussion
Bands a make her do it, do it
Pocket full of money, money
Young nigga getting head while the engine's runnin'
Err! Let me see you wiggle do it for a real nigga
I be laughing to the bank, all you do is kiggle
Balling in my coupe, call it sports car
Drop the top and freak the chick
That bitch just like a porn star

My blue drink
My hydroplonic,
My candy jelly bean
Can't you fix me up,
I'm your number one fan
Be my little pill
And just creep into my blood stream
Bloodshot eyes,
I'm hopped upon it
You ain't gotta think twice
Just hop upon it
There's a million names for your kind of chronic
Huh,
That pusher love
That's what I call it
(Pusher love)
I'm just a (J-j-j-junkie for your love)
I'm hopped upon it
Now I'm just a (J-j-j-junkie for your love)
Let me hear you say

Future - Neva End Lyrics

We don't want it
We don't want
We don't want it neva end
We don't want
We don't want it neva end
We don't want
We don't want it neva end
We don't want it neva

We don't want it neva end
It's like our life is just begin
You walkin' out, you comin' back again
Cause we became the best of friends
You got all the questions and I know all the answers
I took your heart, girl, holding it up for ransom
We don't want it neva end
We don't want

We don't want it neva end
We don't want

I could tell you was into me, from my instant chemistry
As I reflect memory, you ride or you die for me
I'll go to war over you I don't give a fuck about showing you
You know what it is, Shorty, forever my lil shawty
Long as I'm swimmin' in Benjamins, you shop with no limited
You'll see reminisce every session, know you'll come back again
I know you can't breath without me, you gon' need the oxygen
I damn near gave you an overdose, on my own medicine

I took a sip of your tea and I ain't been right ever since
As I think to myself what'd it have been heaven sent
Let's put the past behind us
And go far away where nobody can find us

We don't want it neva end
It's like our life is just begin
You walkin' out, you comin' back again
Cause we became the best of friends

You got all the questions and I know all the answers
I took your heart, girl, holding it up for ransom
We don't want it neva end
We don't want
We don't want it neva end
We don't want

You could leave today, I bet you'll come back tomorrow
I could see the haters comin' from a mile off
And it's preparin' us, for what we got comin'
If they come your way, and you feel like runnin'
Run in my direction, and don't you run from me

Cause anytime we get together, we gon stunt them
And I'm applyin' major pressure, feel it in your stomach
It's lightnin', it's thunderin', it is striking got me wonderin'
Butterfly, butterfly
When you gon ever leave?
Any time you leave my side
I know you comin' back
I know you comin' back to me

We don't want it neva end
It's like our life is just begin
You walkin' out, you comin' back again
Cause we became the best of friends
You got all the questions and I know all the answers
I took your heart, girl, holding it up for ransom
We don't want it neva end
We don't want
We don't want it neva end
We don't want

Is there anything you wanna know?
Is there any place you rather be?
You walk until your feet get sore
I bet you walking back
I bet you walking back to me
Actually that's a guarantee
Our friendship was guaranteed
You got my ego in another league
I ain't tryna be cocky
I got your heart in my pocket

We don't want it neva end
It's like our life is just begin
You walkin' out, you comin' back again
Cause we became the best of friends
You got all the questions and I know all the answers
I took your heart, girl, holding it up for ransom
We don't want it neva end
We don't want
We don't want it neva end
We don't want
