Bebe Rexha - Meant To Be Lyrics

Baby lay on back and relax
Kick your pretty feet up on my dash
No need to go nowhere fast
Let's enjoy right here where we at
Who knows where this road supposed to lead?
We got nothing but time

As long as you're right here next to me
Everything's gonna be alright
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby just let it be
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby just let it be
So won't you ride with me, ride with me?
See where this thing goes
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby if it's meant to be
I don't need to be so uptight
But my heart's been hurt a couple times
By a couple guys that didn't treat me right
I ain't gon' lie, ain't gonna lie
Cause I'm tired of the fake love, show me
what you're made of
Boy make me believe
But hold up girl don't you know you're beautiful?
And it's easy to see
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby just let it be
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby just let it be
So won't you ride with me, ride with me?
See where this thing goes
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby if it's meant to be
So come on, ride with me, ride with me
See where this thing goes
So come on, ride with me, ride with me
Baby if it's meant to be
Maybe we do
Maybe we don't
Maybe we will
Maybe we won't
But if it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby just let it be
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby just let it be
So won't you ride with me, ride with me?
See where this thing goes
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby if it's meant to be
If it's meant to be, it'll be, it'll be
Baby if it's meant to be

Thomas Rhett - Marry Me Lyrics

She wants to get married, she wants it perfect
She wants her granddaddy preaching the service
Yeah, she wants magnolias out in the country
Not too many people, save her daddy some money

Ooh, she got it all planned out
Yeah, I can see it all right now

I'll wear my black suit, black tie, hide out in the back
I'll do a strong shot of whiskey straight out the flask
I'll try to make it through without crying so nobody sees
Yeah, she wanna get married
But she don't wanna marry me

I remember the night when I almost kissed her
Yeah, I kinda freaked out, we'd been friends for forever
And I always wondered if she felt the same way
When I got the invite, I knew it was too late

And I know her daddy's been dreading this day
Oh, but he don't know he ain't the only one giving her away

I'll wear my black suit, black tie, hide out in the back
I'll do a strong shot of whiskey straight out the flask
I'll try to make it through without crying so nobody sees
Yeah, she wanna get married
But she don't wanna marry me

Bet she got on her dress now, welcoming the guests now
I could try to find her, get it off of my chest now
But I ain't gonna mess it up, so I'll wish her the best now

So I'm in my black suit, black tie, hiding out in the back
Doing a strong shot of whiskey straight out the flask
I'll try to make it through without crying so nobody sees
Yeah, she wanna get married
Yeah, she gonna get married
But she ain't gonna marry me
Whoa, but she ain't gonna marry me, no

Brett Young - Like I Loved You Lyrics

You would've thought you wrote down every word
Goodbye spelled out like it had been rehearsed
There ain't no point in trying to change your mind
Seems like
You've got it all figured out
You're alright
With the way this is going down

Don't tell me we can still be friends
Hanging on the weekend
You're gonna be okay if I start seeing somebody new
You hope that I do
And won't be alone
Till I forget to call every time that I'm drinking
And you ain't the love song
I can't keep from singing
I gotta be honest
You really believe that's the truth
You never loved me like I loved you

By the way you're talking you would think
You never had any real feelings for me
And if you think I can look across the bar
And see you
In someone else's arms
And I need you
Oh who do you think you are

Trying to tell me we can still be friends
Hanging on the weekend
You're gonna be okay if I start seeing somebody new
You hope that I do
And won't be alone
Till I forget to call every time that I'm drinking
And you ain't the love song
I can't keep from singing
I gotta be honest
You really believe that's the truth
You never loved me like I loved you

You always told me
You'd never leave me
You said I was your one and only
So what makes you think I wanna hear you say

We can still be friends
No I don't wanna be friends
Stop telling me, stop telling me, woah

That we can still be friends
Hanging on the weekend
You're gonna be okay if I start seeing somebody new
You hope that I do
And won't be alone
Till I forget to call every time that I'm drinking
And you ain't the love song
I can't keep from singing
I gotta be honest
You really believe that's the truth
You never loved me like I loved you
You never loved me like I loved you
You never loved me like I loved you

Russell Dickerson - Yours Lyrics

I was a boat stuck in a bottle
That never got the chance to touch the sea
Just forgot on the shelf
No wind in the sails
Going no where with no one but me

I was one in one-hundred billion
A burned out star in a galaxy
Just lost in the sky wondering why
everyone else shines out but me

But...
I came alive when I first kissed you
The best me has his arms around you
You make me better than I was before
Thank God I'm yours

I was a worn out set of shoes
Wondering the city street
Another face in the crowd
Head looking down
Lost in the sound of a lonely melody
Empty pockets at a roulette
Always landing on a lost bet
Just live for the spin and hope for the win
Go all in just to lose again

But...
I came alive when I first kissed you
The best me has his arms around you
You make me better than I was before
Thank God I'm yours
The worst me is just a long gone memory
You put a new heart beat inside of me
You make me better than I was before
Thank God I'm yours

I was a boat stuck in a bottle
That never got a chance to touch the sea

I came alive when I first kissed you
The best me has his arms around you
You make me better than I was before
Thank God I'm yours
The worst me is just a long gone memory
You put a new heart beat inside of me
You make me better than I was before
Thank God I'm yours
Thank God I'm yours
Thank God I'm yours
Thank God I'm yours

Kane Brown - What Ifs Lyrics

You say what if I hurt you
What if I leave you
What if I find somebody else
And I don't need you
What if this goes south
What if I mess you up
You say what if I break out
In two then what
Well I hear you girl
I feel you girl but not so fast
Before you make your mind up
I gotta ask

What if I was made for you
And you were made for me
What if this is it
What if it's meant to be
What if I ain't one of them
Fools just Playin' some game
What if I just pulled you close
What if I leaned in
And the stars line up
And it's our last first kiss
What if one of these days baby
I'd go and change your name
What if
I loved all these what ifs away

What if the sky falls
(sky falls)
Or the sun stops burning
We could worry about them
What ifs 'til the world stops turnin'
Or I could kiss you
What if you liked it
(bet I'd like it)
Well we ain't
Never gonna know unless we try it
What if I was made for you
And you were made for me

What if this is it
What if it's meant to be
What if I ain't one of them
Fools just Playin' some game
What if I just pulled you close
What if I leaned in
And the stars line up
And it's our last first kiss
What if one of these days baby
I'd go and change your name
What if I loved all
These what ifs away

Awe yeah
C'mon

You say what if I hurt you
What if I leave you
What if I find somebody else and
I don't need you
Damn

What if I was made for you
And you were made for me
What if this is it
What if it's meant to be

What if I ain't one of them
Fools just Playin' some game
Yeah
What if I just pulled you close
What if I leaned in
And the stars line up and
It's our last first kiss
What if one of these days baby
I'd go and change your name
What if I loved all these
What is away

Away
(away)
What if?

Sam Hunt - Body Like A Back Road Lyrics

Got a girl from the Southside
Got braids in her hair
First time I seen her walk by
Man I 'Bout fell up out my chair

Had to get her number
Took me like 6 weeks
Now me and her go way back
Like Cadillac seats

Body like a back road
Could drive it with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' fifteen in a thirty
I ain't in no hurry
I'm a take it slow just as fast as I can

The way she fit in them blue jeans
She don't need no belt
But I can turn 'em inside out
I don't need no help

Got hips like honey
So thick and so sweet
Ain't no curves like hers
On them downtown streets

Body like a back road
Could drive it with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' fifteen in a thirty
I ain't in no hurry
I'm a take it slow just as fast as I can

We're out here in the boondocks
With the breeze and the birds
Tangled up in the tall grass
With my lips on hers

On a highway to Heaven
Headed south of her smile
Get there when we get there
Every inch is a mile

Body like a back road
Could drive it with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' fifteen in a thirty
I ain't in no hurry
I'm a take it slow just as fast as I can

I'm take it slow just as fast I can

Got the breeze, aah ha

(Body like a back road
Could drive it with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand)

Maren Morris - I Could Use A Love Song Lyrics

Usually a drink will do the trick
Take the edge off quick, sittin' in the dark
With a shared cigarette
Seeing eye-to-eye, and heart-to-heart
But maybe I'm just gettin' old
Used to work but now it don't

A long gone drive
You know the kind where you take a turn and you don't know why
But it clears your mind, a surefire cure
I need somethin' stronger
That'll last a little longer

I could use a love song
That takes me back, just like that
When it comes on
To a time when I wouldn't roll my eyes
At a guy and a girl
Who make it work in a world
That for me so far just seems to go so wrong
Yeah I could use, I could use a love song

I wish I didn't know so much
I peeked behind the curtain
Now that magic rush
Feels like a trick that isn't workin'
But I haven't lost all hope yet
Yeah it's hurtin' but it ain't dead

I could use a love song
That takes me back, just like that
When it comes on
To a time when I wouldn't roll my eyes
At a guy and a girl
Who make it work in a world
That for me so far just seems to go so wrong
Yeah I could use, I could use a love song

Give me a sign or a rhyme or a reason
Just somethin' that I can believe in
I could use a love song
That takes me back, just like that

When it comes on
To a time when I wouldn't roll my eyes
At a guy and a girl
Who make it work in a world
That for me so far just seems to go so wrong
Yeah I could use
Yeah I could use, I could use a love song

Eric Church - Round Here Buzz Lyrics

Another Friday night
There's a line of cars leaving
Home team's got an out-of-towner
Me, I'm sitting on the hood of mine drinking
I'm just a parking lot down-and-outer

Under that high school bleacher
I drove that preacher's daughter crazy
Her mama was my homeroom teacher
And her dad was hell bent on saving me

Yeah, I'm sure there's higher highs
Where the high risers rise
But me, I'm gonna sit right here tonight, and

Catch me a 'round here buzz
Cause you ain't 'round here none
Keep putting 'em down here, 'nother round here
'Til my down goes up
Lit up like that one stoplight
Across from that welcome sign
Ever since you caught that out there bug
I catch me a 'round here buzz

I never had big-city eyes
Hell, I've never been east of Dallas
Got no idea where you are now
Or if you ever got that penthouse palace

No, Scotty's ain't got no vibe
Got no gas in his neon light
But he's got two-for-one 'til 2: 00 tonight

Catch me a 'round here buzz
Cause you ain't 'round here none
Keep putting 'em down here, 'nother round here
'Til my down goes up
Lit up like that one stoplight
Across from that welcome sign
Ever since you caught that out there bug
I catch me a 'round here buzz

Catch me a 'round here buzz
Cause you ain't 'round here none
Keep putting 'em down here, 'nother round here
'Til my down here
Is lit up like that one stoplight
Across from that welcome sign
Ever since you caught that out there bug
I catch me a 'round here buzz
I catch me a 'round here buzz
'Round here buzz
I catch me a 'round here buzz

LANCO - Greatest Love Story Lyrics

They said I was nothing but a troublemaker
Never up to no good
You were the perfect all American girl
Wouldn't touch me even if you could
But you was sneaking out your window every night
Riding shotgun in my car
We go to the river and find us a spot
And probably went a little too far
Just a little too far

Cause I was gonna be your forever
You were gonna be my wife
We didn't know any better
Didn't have a clue about life

But I was what you wanted
you were what I needed
And we could meet in between
We were gonna be the greatest love story
This town had ever seen

So you went off to college and I got a job
I was working that nine to five

Dreaming of the days when you were in my arms
I have never felt so alive
I spent my days working, spent my nights drinking
Howling at the moon

Screaming for the days when you were coming back
No couldn't come too soon
Couldn't come too soon

When I was gonna be your forever
You were gonna be my wife
But you went off to find better
And I was learning all about life
But I was what you wanted and you were what I needed
And we could meet in between
We were gonna be the greatest love story
This town had ever seen

So you came back after a long four years
Your college boyfriend didn't work out
So we went out for a couple of drinks
To find out who we are now
Sure we changed but way deep down
You had the same old feelings for me
So I went to the store and I bought you a ring
and I got down on one knee
Got down on one knee

And I said
I am gonna be your forever
So baby will you be my wife
Now that we know a little better
We could have a real nice life
Cause I'm what you wanted and your what I need
So let's meet in between
We are gonna be the greatest love story
This town has ever seen
We are gonna be the greatest love story
This world has ever seen

So baby say yes to me

Light a candle
Turn all the lights down low
Baby, let's just lose control, lose control
I can handle every single curve, you know
That I love you, let me show you, oh

Fall into me, let me breathe the air you breathe
I can take you anywhere you wanna be
When it comes to us every single touch is something special
When we're wrapped up in those sheets
Yeah, we're winning, we're losing
When we're losing sleep

Real life, when it's this good don't you know
We don't need to dream at all
Baby, so...

Fall into me, let me breathe the air you breathe
I can take you anywhere you wanna be
When it comes to us every single touch is something special
When we're wrapped up in those sheets
Yeah, we're winning, we're losing
When we're losing sleep

Fall into me, let me breathe the air you breathe
I can take you anywhere you wanna be, yeah
When it comes to us every single touch is something special
When we're wrapped up in those sheets
Yeah, we're winning, we're losing
When we're losing sleep
When we're losing sleep
Yeah, we're winning, we're losing

Girl, it's high time, I tell ya
No more messing around
Time to lay these cards on the table
And just throw it on out

I'm talking you and me with the same street name
Same last name, same everything
It's a real thing, a how I feel thing
So I'ma go on and take a swing

You'll find the spot and I'll find the money
You'll be the pretty and I'll be the funny
You'll plant the flowers, I'll plant the kisses
Baby, let's get right down to business

I'll hang the pictures, you'll hang the stars
You'll pick the paint, I'll pick a guitar
Sing you a song out there with the crickets and the frogs
You'll name the babies and I'll name the dogs, yeah

You can park your car in the driveway
I'll park my truck in the grass
I'll put a little swing on the front porch
If you put a little tea in my glass

Watch the sun set from a gravel road
Kiss me in the kitchen on your tippy toes
Still loving on you when the rooster crows
Watching way more than the garden grow

You'll find the spot and I'll find the money
You'll be the pretty and I'll be the funny
You'll plant the flowers, I'll plant the kisses
Baby, let's get right down to business

I'll hang the pictures, you'll hang the stars
You'll pick the paint, I'll pick a guitar
Sing you a song out there with the crickets and the frogs
You'll name the babies and I'll name the dogs

Yeah, laying next to you every night
Sounds like a damn good life

You'll find the spot and I'll find the money
You'll be the pretty and I'll be the funny
You'll plant the flowers, I'll plant the kisses
Baby, let's get right down to business

I'll hang the pictures, you'll hang the stars
You'll pick the paint, I'll pick a guitar
Sing you a song out there with the crickets and the frogs
You'll name the babies and I'll name the dogs
Yeah, I'll name the dogs
You'll name the babies and I'll name the dogs
Yeah, I'll name the dogs

Walker Hayes - You Broke Up With Me Lyrics

Hey

Well I got some coke in my bourbon
Surfin' the room like Swazye
No, I ain't drunk, I'm amazin'
Yeah, I got that laid way way back back in my swagger
Xfactor feeling no pain
I'm at the top of my game

Darlin' you can't crash my party with your 'Sorry's and 'What Are We's
Dont start rainin' on my Mardi Gras parade for a minute
I aint even fixin' to listen to your guilt trippin'
You're forgettin' girl you made your bed and didn't want me in it (Hey!)
Woah girl, simmer on down a notch

Ain't nobody makin' you watch me get my forget you on
No girl, can't touch my good as gold
I know it's difficult to see me on a roll
But hey, you broke up with me
Yeah, what can I say babe, you broke up with me.

Ha. Guess you don't know what you want
'til you see I'm movin' on
Makin' lonely look like freedom
Baby don't even act like I'm doin' somethin' wrong
If my song comes on and I get lost on that dance floor
In somebody's arms that ain't yours

You can't crash my party with your 'Sorry's and 'What Are We's
Don't be rainin' on my Mardi Gras parade for a minute
I aint even fixin' to listen to your guilt trippin'
You're forgettin' girl you made your bed and didn't want me in it (Hey!)
Woah girl, simmer on down a notch
Ain't nobody makin' you watch me get my forget you on
No girl, can't touch my good as gold
I know it's difficult to see me on a roll (Hey!)
But hey, you broke up with me
Yeah, what can I say babe, you broke up with me.

For real babe, ain't tryin' rub it your face
I'm just breakin' off a little cold hard truth
It is what it is girl, you did what you did girl
I'm just doin' what a bachelor do

Darlin' you can't crash my party with your 'Sorry's and 'What Are We's
Don't be rainin' on my Mardi Gras parade for a minute (Quit it!)
I ain't even fixin' to listen to your guilt trippin'
You're forgettin' girl you made your bed and didn't want me in it (Hey!)
Woah girl, simmer on down a notch
Ain't nobody making you watch me get my forget you on

No girl, can't touch my good as gold
I know it's difficult to see me on a roll
But hey, you broke up with me
Yeah, what can I say babe, you broke up with me.

Old Dominion - Written In The Sand Lyrics

Turn me on, turn me off, then you turn me back on by the weekend
And you won't say the words that I want but you flirt when you're drinkin'
I see those bubbles pop up like you're texting then they disappear
Let's cut through the shit and let's get to what we're doing here

Are we just a backseat, tryna get it while we can?
Are we names in a tattoo, or just a number on a hand?
Are we last-call kissing or will we be reminiscing
With each other for the next forty years?
Are we written in the stars, baby, or are we written in the sand?

Yeah, I want you to want me to take you back home to my mama
Put my name on your lips call me yours and forget all this drama (Forget it all)
Your makeup is next to my toothbrush but you never put it away on the shelf
I'm asking you baby 'cause I'm tired of asking myself

Are we just a backseat, tryna get it while we can?
Are we names in a tattoo, or just a number on a hand?
Are we last-call kissing, are we dancing in the kitchen?
Baby tell me what it is or what it isn't
Are we written in the stars, baby, or are we written in the sand?

Are we just a backseat, tryna get it while we can?
Are we names in a tattoo, or just a number I should wash right off my hand?
Are we last call kissing or will we be reminiscing
With each other for the next forty years?
Are we written in the stars baby, or are we written in the sand?
Are we written in the stars baby, or are we written in the sand?

Kane Brown - Heaven Lyrics

This is perfect
Come kiss me one more time
I couldn't dream this up
Even if i tried
You and me in this moment
Feels like magic only
I'm right where I wanna be

Everybody's talking about heaven like they just can't wait to go
Saying how it's gonna be so good, so beautiful
Lying next to you, in this bed with you, I ain't convinced
Cause, I don't know how, I don't know how heaven, heaven
Could be better than this

I swear you're and angel
Sent to this world
What did I do right to deserve you, girl?
I could stay here forver
I'd be fine if we never had to even leave this room

Everybody's talking about heaven like they just can't wait to go
Saying how it's gonna be so good, so beautiful
Lying next to you, in this bed with you, I ain't convinced
Cause, I don't know how, I don't know how heaven, heaven
Could be better than this
Could be better than this

Everybody's talking about heaven like they just can't wait to go
Saying how it's gonna be so good, so beautiful
Lying next to you, in this bed with you, I ain't convinced
Cause, I don't know how, I don't know how heaven, heaven
Could be better than this (Heaven)
Could be better than this (Heaven, heaven)

I swear this is perfect
Come kiss me one more time

Scotty McCreery - Five More Minutes Lyrics

Eight years old, couple cane poles sittin' there by the creek
Lines in the water, watchin' those bobbers, seein' that red sun sink
Mama's on the porch yellin' "supper hot! Ya'll come and get it!"
We yelled "five more minutes"
Sixteen, it was 12: 03 standing at her front door
Katie's dadsaid midnight but we needed just a little more
Yellow light flippin' on and off interupting that good night kissin'
We wanted five more minutes
Time rolls by the clock don't stop
I wish I had a few more drops
Of the good stuff, the good times
Oh but they just keep on flying
Right on by like it ain't nothing
Wish I had me a pause button
Moments like those Lord knows I'd hit it
Give myself five more minutes
At eighteen turned my helmet in and walked to the fifty yard line
It's just the coach and me after we lost eighteen to nine
And I cried man next time to get in here I'll have to buy a ticket
Can't you give me five more minute
Time rolls by the clock don't stop
I wish I had a few more drops
Of the good stuff, the good times
Oh but they just keep on flying
Right on by like it ain't nothing
Wish I had me a pause button
Moments like those Lord knows I'd hit it
Give myself five more minutes
At eighty-six my grandpa said there's angels in the room
With all the family gathered 'round we knew the time was coming soon
With so much left to say I prayed Lord I ain't finished
Just give us five more minutes
Time rolls by the clock don't stop
I wish I had a few more drops
Of the good stuff, the good times
Oh but they just keep on flying
Right on by like it ain't nothing
Wish I had me a pause button
Moments like those Lord knows I'd hit it
Yeah sometimes this all life will leave you wishing
That you had five more minutes
five more minutes

Thomas Rhett - Unforgettable Lyrics

It was the 14th of October
Had that t-shirt off your shoulder
I was drunk, said I was sober
And you said yeah right
We were talkin' for a minute
Then some guy tried to cut in
You took my hand and we pretended
Like I was your guy

Oh, then I tried to guess your middle name
For 30 minutes bet we played that game

That mango-rita you were drinkin'
And that Coldplay song that you were singin'
And I bet right now you're probably thinkin'
That it's crazy I remember every detail, but I do
From your blue jeans to your shoes
Girl, that night was just like you
Unforgettable

We were dancin', we were buzzin'
Takin' shots like it was nothin'
Did the runnin' man, you loved it
Yeah, you laughed out loud
You brushed away your blonde hair
And you kissed me out of nowhere
I can still show you the spot
Where everything went down

Oh, I told you I was gonna marry you
You probably didn't think that it was true

That mango-rita you were drinkin'
And that Coldplay song that you were singin'
And I bet right now you're probably thinkin'
That it's crazy I remember every detail, but I do
I can still smell your perfume
Girl, that night was just like you
Unforgettable

Oh, that night was just like you, baby
I can taste the mango-rita you were drinkin'
And it feels just like it was last weekend
That we jumped in
Right off the deep end

That mango-rita you were drinkin'
And that Coldplay song that you were singin'
And I bet right now you're probably thinkin'
That it's crazy I remember every detail, but I do
I can still smell your perfume
Girl, that night was just like you
Unforgettable

From your blue jeans to your shoes
Girl, that night was just like you
Unforgettable

Yeah I know that the woes and the weight of the world can get in side our minds
And be too much sometimes

Come and lay on me
When it gets heavy put the weight on me

Wanna take you out on the town on my dime anytime
Tell me when you're free
We can do anything and everything you want yeah
Oh I wanna hear all your fears and your troubles
Strip it down, really get to know one another
When it's nobody but you and me just us

Kelsea Ballerini - Legends Lyrics

We were golden, we were fire, we were magic
Yeah and they all knew our names all over town
We had it made in the middle of the madness
We were neon in a gray cloud

Yeah, we wrote our own story
Full of blood sweat and heartbeats
We didn't do it for the fame or the glory
But we went down in history

Yeah we were legends
Loving you baby it was Heaven
What everyone wondered we'd never question
Close our eyes and took on the world together
Do you remember?
We were crazy
Tragic and epic and so amazing
I'll always wear the crown that you gave me
We will always stay lost in forever
And they'll remember
We were legends

Like we were written down in permanent marker
Not even the brightest sun could ever fade
Come whichever hell or high water
It was always me and you either way

Hey we wrote our own story
Full of blood sweat and heartbeats
We didn't do it for the fame or the glory
We just did it for you and me

And that's why we were legends
Loving you baby it was Heaven
What everyone wondered we'd never question
Close our eyes and took on the world together
Do you remember?
We were crazy
Tragic and epic and so amazing
I'll always wear the crown that you gave me
We will always stay lost in forever
And they'll remember
We were legends

We were legends
Loving you baby it was Heaven
What everyone wondered we'd never question
Close our eyes and took on the world together
Do you remember baby?
We were crazy
Tragic and epic and so amazing
I'll always wear the crown that you gave me
We will always stay lost in forever
And they'll remember
We were legends

We were
Yeah, we were legends
Yeah, we wrote our own story

Chris Stapleton - Broken Halos Lyrics

Seen my share of broken halos
Folded wings that used to fly
They've all gone wherever they go
Broken halos that used to shine

Angels come down from the heavens
Just to help us on our way
Come to teach us, then they leave us
And they find some other soul to save

Seen my share of broken halos
Folded wings that used to fly
They've all gone wherever they go
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine

Don't go looking for the reasons
Don't go asking Jesus why
We're not meant to know the answers
They belong to the by and by
They belong to the by and by

Seen my share of broken halos
Folded wings that used to fly
They've all gone wherever they go
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine

Keith Urban - Female Lyrics

When you hear somebody say somebody hits like a girl
How does that hit you?
Is that such a bad thing?
When you hear a song that they play saying you run the world
Do you believe it?
Will you live to see it?

Sister, shoulder, daughter, lover
Healer, broken halo, mother
Nature, fire, suit of armor
Soul survivor, holy water
Secret keeper, fortune teller
Virgin Mary, scarlet letter
Technicolor, river wild
Baby girl, woman child
Female

When somebody laughs and implies that she asked for it
Just 'cause she was wearin' a skirt
Oh, is that how that works?
When somebody talks about how it was Adam first
Does that make you second best
Or did He save the best for last?

Sister, shoulder, daughter, lover
Healer, broken halo, mother
Nature, fire, suit of armor
Soul survivor, holy water
Secret keeper, fortune teller
Virgin Mary, scarlet letter
Technicolor, river wild
Baby girl, woman child
Female
Yeah, female

She's the heart of life
She's the dreamer's dream
She's the hands of time
She's the queen of kings

Sister, shoulder, daughter, lover
Healer, broken halo, mother
Nature, fire, suit of armor
Soul survivor, holy water
Secret keeper, fortune teller
Virgin Mary, scarlet letter
Technicolor, river wild
Baby girl, woman child
Female
Mhm, female

Luke Bryan - Light It Up Lyrics

I open my eyes
Reach for the phone
Not a word from ya baby
It don't leave my sight since we had that fight
Can't remember but maybe
I blew you up in the middle of the night again
You were drinking with your friends
You ignored it, but you got it

I get so neurotic about it baby
Cause I know you're reading your phone
I can't help I'm going crazy
Thinking you might not be all alone
I wake up, I check it
I shower and I check it
I feel the buzz in my truck and I almost wreck it
I always got it on me just in case you want me
So if you're looking for my love then light it up

Every time I unlock my screen
I hope I see one of them red lipstick I miss you pictures
I'm on your clock
You're in control
You want me now, baby go figure
My world's at the tips of your fingers

I get so neurotic about it baby
Cause I know you're reading your phone
I can't help I'm going crazy
Thinking you might not be all alone
I wake up, I check it
I shower and I check it
I feel the buzz in my truck and I almost wreck it
I always got it on me just in case you want me
So if you're looking for my love then light it up

Yeah baby light it up

I go to sleep, I check it
In the middle of the night I check it
I feel the buzz in my bed and I don't get no rest
I always got it on me just in case you want me
So if you're looking for my love then light it up

Yeah baby light it up

Easton Corbin Lyrics - A Girl Like You


Got lots of bars around this town
They got cold beer, yeah, and they got Crown
Got neon light in the windowpane
Got lots of guys thinkin' they got game
Got loud guitars a little out of tune
But they ain't got a girl like you
Naw, they don't

They play lots of songs on the radio
'Bout them good ole' country girls that we all know
Long tan legs and cutoff jeans
Yeah, just shakin' that sugar every country boy's dream
I've heard them all at least a time or two
Ain't none 'bout a girl like you, that's true

You've got that beautiful born with it kind of thing
It comes so natural, no baby don't ever change
And I wonder when I see the smile on your face
Baby, what did I do to ever get a girl like you
A girl like you

You can dress it on up or you can just hang out
Kick it on Broadway or kick back on the couch
You can dance on a bar, you can dance in the rain
Shotgun a beer, just sip champagne
Yeah, there's only one, ain't room for two
There ain't another girl like you, another girl like you

You've got that beautiful born with it kind of thing
It comes so natural, no baby don't ever change
And I wonder when I see the smile on your face
Baby, what did I do to ever get a girl like you
A girl like you

Baby, what did I do to get a girl like you

A girl like you don't come along but once in a lifetime, better hang on
I can't find one thing wrong, I could just go on and on and on

You've got that beautiful born with it kind of thing
It comes so natural, no baby don't ever change
And I wonder when I see the smile on your face
Baby, what did I do to ever get a girl like you
A girl like you

I could sail the ocean blue, and never find, never find a girl like you

Brett Eldredge - The Long Way Lyrics

Don't think I've ever seen your kind of pretty
Wandering around this midnight mad house city
You got a look that says you got it all together
So if you don't, mind I'd like to know you better

Take me the long way around your town
Where you the queen with the silver crown
I want the secrets you keep, the shine underneath
Of the diamond I think I just found
Take me the long way around

I'd love to see just where your daddy met your momma
Your hand-me-down '99 Impala
Show me the field you danced in clover
The harvest in October
When the leaves fall from the sky just like a Sunday drive

Take me the long way around your town
Where you the queen with the silver crown
I want the secrets you keep, the shine underneath
Of the diamond I think I just found
Take me the long way around

Didn't think tonight when I walked in
I'd be falling for somewhere I've never been

Take me the long way around your town
Where you the queen with the silver crown
I want your red blushing stories
Your faults and your glories
That made you who you are right now
Take me the long way around
Take me the long way around

Lee Brice - Boy Lyrics

Boy, you're gonna know it all
You'll think you're ten feet tall
And run like you're bulletproof
And total a car or two
Boy, you're gonna hate this town
Wish you could burn it down
That fire in your eyes is 20 counties wide
But boy, you're gonna love 17
And boy, you'll do some stupid things

You're gonna drive and kiss
And throw a punch
And grow up way too fast
You're gonna drop the ball
Hit the wall
And break some hearts like glass
I know you will, 'cause you're a part of me
And a part of you will always be a boy

Boy, you're gonna be so stubborn
You get that from your mother
I already see it now, you weren't built for backing down
And boy, there'll be a small town night
And you'll fall for her sky-blue eyes
And when she's in your hands
You'll think you're a man and not a boy
She'll make you lose your mind, boy
She'll be every reason why

You're gonna drive and kiss
And throw a punch
And grow up way too fast
You're gonna drop the ball
Hit the wall
And break some hearts like glass
I know you will, 'cause you're a part of me
And a part of you will always be...my boy

It's 3am and I'd do anything to get you back to sleep
And that face will be the same one in the rearview
The day I watch you leave

But boy, you're gonna come back home
You're gonna settle down
But you won't feel the way I'm feelin' now
Til you have a boy
He's gonna know it all
He'll think he's ten feet tall
And run like he's bulletproof
And total a car or two

Granger Smith - Happens Like That Lyrics

You order a drink, it goes down smooth
Before you can blink, it turns into two
It was just gonna be another night with the boys
Shooting some pool, pickin' a stool, and making some noise
Then she walks in and I never dance
Turns to tippin' the band and taking her hand
Aw man

It happens like that
Outta the blue sky, lost in her blue eyes
Yeah, when it happens like that
Nothing to lose turns right into you
Doing all you can do just to keep her around
Til the moon goes down and you're back at your house
One thing leads to another, you're loving each other
One look and you never look back
It happens like that
It happens like that

I guess that's what you get
It's true what they say
As soon as you stop looking, it's right in front of your face
Cause there you were and there I was and here we are, I tell you what

True love, it happens like that
Outta the blue sky, lost in her blue eyes
Yeah, when it happens like that
Nothing to lose turns right into you
Doing all you can do just to keep her around
Til the moon goes down and you're back at your house
One thing leads to another, you're loving each other
One look and you never look back
It happens like that, yeah

Ever wonder how just one drink
Turns into one knee down with a diamond ring

It happens like that
Outta the blue sky, lost in her blue eyes
Yeah, when it happens like that
Nothing to lose turns right into you
Doing all you can do just to keep her around
Til the moon goes down and you're back at your house
One thing leads to another, you're loving each other
One look and you never look back
It happens like that

You order a drink, it goes down smooth
Before you can blink, it turns into two

When the devil's knocking at my door
When I'm broken and I'm battle worn
Down in the valley, on my knees
Yea she's, yea she's with me

Ain't she amazing, amazing, out of my league?
And ain't it crazy, crazy, she happened to me?
She calls me baby, baby, hard to believe
That she's, yea she's with me

When my dreams are running out of road
And the world around me's turning cold
Anyone else would up and leave
But she's, yea she's with me

Ain't she amazing, amazing, out of my league?
And ain't it crazy, crazy, she happened to me?
She calls me baby, baby, hard to believe
That she's, yea she's with me

Top of the mountain and all the way down
When I'm lost and when I'm found
In the day, in the light, in the dark of the night
When it all goes wrong, when it all goes right
Whoa oh, I don't know what I'd do without her
Whoa oh, she's gotta know I'm all about her

She's amazing, amazing
Ain't she amazing, amazing?

Ain't she amazing, amazing, out of my league?
And ain't it crazy, crazy, she happened to me?
She calls me baby, baby, hard to believe
That she's, yea she's with me

Ain't she amazing, amazing? (That girl, she's out of my league)
And ain't it crazy, crazy, she happened to me?
She calls me baby, baby, hard to believe
That she's, yea she's with me
That she's, yea she's with me

Top of the mountain and all the way down
When I'm lost and when I'm found
In the day, in the light, in the dark of the night
When it all goes wrong, when it all goes right

Top of the mountain and all the way down
When I'm lost and when I'm found
In the day, in the light, in the dark of the night
When it all goes wrong, when it all goes right

Morgan Wallen - Up Down Lyrics

Was Friday after five, I got here just in time
Went ahead and wet a line 'fore I went and lost my mind
I ain't been here long, but the bobbers in the pond
Going up down, up, down, up, down
Tonight, we're gonna raise a whole lot more than Cain
'Cause there's money in the bank and tomorrow's Saturday
So if they pass that fifth of Jack this way
I turn it up, down, up, down, up, down

We just holding it down here in BFE
Still rolling around with a burnt CD
Free Bird, five minutes deep
Head bobbing up, down, up, down, up, down
We got what we got, we don't need the rest
Can turn this parking lot into a party
With an ice chest, dancing, cold beer
Man, we live it up, down, up, down
We live it up down, here

Yeah, the girls, they hit the spot, get hotter when it's hot
If you can't buy her a yacht, but still proud of what you got
'Cause when the day's done, red neck is from the sun
Going up, down, up, down, up, down

We just holding it down here in BFE
Still rolling around with a burnt CD
Free Bird, five minutes deep
Head bobbing up, down, up, down, up, down
We got what we got, we don't need the rest
Can turn this parking lot into a party
With an ice chest, dancing, cold beer
Man, we live it up, down, up, down
We live it up, down, here

Somebody pass that fifth of Cap this way
I'll turn it up, down, up, down, up, down

We just holding it down here in BFE
Still rolling around with a burnt CD
Free Bird, five minutes deep
Head bobbing up, down, up, down, up, down
We got what we got, we don't need the rest
Can turn this parking lot into a party
With an ice chest, dancing, cold beer
Man, we live it up, down, up, down
We live it up, down, here

Midland Lyrics - Make A Little


It's a hard living, tail kicking
Trip that we're all on, but I'm betting
We can find a little sunshine in the night
It's a back breaking, soul taking
Road we walk, so what are we waiting for
Baby let's turn off the lights
Cause girl, there's just not enough love in the world

So we should make a little
Generate a little
Maybe even make the world a better place a little
We could turtle dove, Dixie land delight
You know it can't be wrong when it feels so right
It all comes down to you and me girl
There's just not enough love in the world
So we should make a little
Then make a little more tonight

It's a clock punching, cash crunching
And it all adds up to nothing
If you're in this thing long
So don't tease me, it's so easy
To just turn off the TV, and make some headlines of our own
Yeah girl, there's just not enough love in the world

So we should make a little
Conjugate a little
Maybe even make the world a better place a little
We could turtle dove, Dixie land delight
You know it can't be wrong when it feels so right
It all comes down to you and me girl
There's just not enough love in the world
So we should make a little
Then make a little more tonight
That's right

Yeah girl there's just not enough love in the world

So we should make a little
Consummate a little
Maybe even make the world a better place a little
We could turtle dove, Dixie land delight
You know you can't be wrong when it feels so right
It all comes down to you and me girl
There's just not enough love in the world
So we should make a little
Then make a little more
We should make a little
Then make a little more
We should make a little
Then make a little more tonight

Talk about loving all night
Yeah

[Verse 1: Chris Lane & Tori Kelly]
Duffle bag, backseat
My dash, your feet
Those other side of the highway headlights making you shine
My hand, your leg
Playlist playing
Even though I haven't made it yet
I'm dragging it, dropping it in my mind

[Chorus: Chris Lane & Tori Kelly]
You're a drive real slow, down a no lane road
To a house on a hill where the wild things grow
You're wake up in pajamas, not a trace of makeup on ya
You're a help her fix it, having breakfast with my momma
You're a take back home, home, home girl
Home, home, home girl
Take back home, home, home girl
Home, home, home girl

[Verse 2: Tori Kelly & Chris Lane]
You're the kind I wanna take a ride with
Sit by on a Friday night
In the stadium lights, side by side
All the ladies like, "Yeah, she's doing just fine"
Everybody in the bleachers, they all gon' want to meet ya
From my teachers to my preacher
My little crowd pleaser
Parading with you feeling homecoming cool, yeah

[Chorus: Chris Lane & Tori Kelly]
I wanna drive real slow, down a no lane road
To a house on a hill where the wild things grow
You're wake up in pajamas, not a trace of makeup on ya
You're a help her fix it, having breakfast with my momma
You're a take back home, home, home girl
Home, home, home girl
Take back home, home, home girl
Home, home, home girl

[Post-Chorus: Chris Lane & Tori Kelly]
You're a take back, you're a take back
You're a take back home girl
You're a take back home
You're a take back home girl

[Bridge: Chris Lane]
You got that down home, homegrown, found on good ground soul
That down home, home grown, found on good ground soul

[Chorus: Chris Lane & Tori Kelly]
You're a drive real slow, down a no lane road
To a house on a hill where the wild things grow
You're wake up in pajamas, not a trace of makeup on ya
You're a help her fix it, having breakfast with my momma
You're a take back home, home, home girl
Home, home, home girl
Take back home, home, home girl
Home, home, home girl

[Post-Chorus: Chris Lane & Tori Kelly]
You're a take back, you're a take back
You're a take back home girl
You're a take back home, yeah
You're a take back home girl
You're a take back home

Tim McGraw - The Rest Of Our Life Lyrics

Sitting with you in a dark room
Warm by a fireplace
You know there's just something about you
You brighten my day
I got something to run past you
I just hope i say it right
So I take your hand and ask you
Have you made plans for the rest of your life?

There's one thing I should be giving up, giving up now
And that's worryin' about life
Oh, I'll be fine
If one gray hair shows, i'll be fine
If my waistline goes, i'll be fine
Even if time takes its toll
We'll stay young for the rest of our lives

I've been making plans for children
Since I've been looking in your eyes
I even have names picked out for them
Daughter; it'd be Rose
Son; it'd be [?]

There's one thing I should be giving up, giving up now
And that's worrying about life
Oh, I'll be fine
If one gray hair shows, I'll be fine
If my waistline goes, I'll be fine
Even if time takes its toll
We'll stay young for the rest of our lives

I don't really care about those storm clouds brewing
Oh, as long as you're hear by my side
Oh, we'll be young, oh we'll be young
Oh, we'll be young, when we're old

Oh, I'll be fine
If my gray hair shows, I'll be fine
If my waistline goes, I'll be fine
Even when time takes its toll
I'll stay young for the rest of my life
With you, I'll stay young for the rest of my life
With you
We'll stay young for the rest of our life

Darius Rucker - For The First Time Lyrics

You say you never dance to a dashboard
Singin' R.E.M under summer stars
Never lean back on a jet black chevy
Blowing smoke rings in the dark
You don't want to be a rube girl
And I feel just the same
Yeah I know that you don't know me well
But we can make that change

When was the last time you did something for the first time?
Yeah, let yourself go and follow that feeling
Maybe something new is what you're needing
Like a real night, let your head down, feel alive
When was the last time you did something for the first time?

Say you never drink from the bottle
Or some two dollar wine, run barefoot through the mud
Never have the right kiss stolen from your lips
While you watch the Sun go up
Well I know your friends are watching
And they probably disapprove
But give me just half a chance
Girl I'm daring you

When was the last time you did something for the first time?
Yeah, let yourself go and follow that feeling
Maybe something new is what you're needing
Like a real night, let your head down, feel alive
When was the last time you did something for the first time?

Now the way you're looking says you're leaning
I hope I ain't readin' you wrong
Girl the way you're sounding, I think you're thinking
It's been way too long

When was the last time you did something for the first time?
Yeah, let yourself go and follow that feeling
Baby something new is what you're needing
Like a real night, let your head down, feel alive, alive
When was the last time, oh, you did something for the first time girl?
Tell me baby, when was the last time
Yeah, you did something for the first time?

Luke Bryan - Most People Are Good Lyrics

I believe kids oughta stay kids as long as they can
Turn off the screen, go climb a tree, get dirt on their hands
I believe we gotta forgive and make amends
Cause nobody gets a second chance to make new old friends
I believe in working hard for what you've got
Even if it don't add up to a hell of a lot

I believe most people are good
And most Mama's oughta qualify for sainthood
I believe most Friday nights look better underneath neon stadium lights
I believe you love who you love
Ain't nothing you should ever be ashamed of
I believe this world ain't half as bad as it looks
I believe most people are good

I believestreets of gold are worth the work
But I still wanna go even if they were paved in dirt
I believe that youth is spent well on the young
Cause wisdom in your teens would be a lot less fun
I believe if you just go by the nightly news
Your faith in all mankind would be the first thing you lose

I believe most people are good
And most Mama's oughta qualify for sainthood
I believe most Friday nights look better underneath neon stadium lights
I believe you love who you love
Ain't nothing you should ever be ashamed of
I believe this world ain't half as bad as it looks
I believe most people are good

I believe that days go slow and years go fast
And every breath's a gift, the first one to the last

I believe most people are good
And most Mama's oughta qualify for sainthood
I believe most Friday nights look better underneath neon stadium lights
I believe you love who you love
Ain't nothing you should ever be ashamed of
I believe this world ain't half as bad as it looks
I believe most people are good

I believe most people are good
I believe most people are good

Brothers Osborne - Shoot Me Straight Lyrics

Baby, I'm a renegade
Baby, you're a firestorm
Move your body close to mine
We can dance into the dawn
I can see we're getting late
The way you, the way you, the way you look tonight
And I could lose a year of sleep
The way you, the way you, the way you look tonight

Shoot me straight into my heart
We don't have to take it slow
Love me like we're out of time
Easy come and easy go
Cut me deep into the bone
You're my perfect getaway
I am right where I belong
We got more than words can say

Baby, I'm a renegade
Baby, you're a firestorm
Move your body close to mine
We can dance into the dawn
I can see we're getting late
The way you, the way you, the way you look tonight
And I could lose a year of sleep
The way you, the way you, the way you look tonight

The way you, the way you, the way you look tonight
The way you, the way you, the way you look tonight

Baby, I'm a renegade
Baby, you're a firestorm
Move your body close to mine
We can dance into the dawn
I can see we're getting late
The way you, the way you, the way you look tonight
And I could lose a year of sleep
The way you, the way you, the way you look tonight

Shoot me straight into my heart
We don't have to take it slow
Love me like we're out of time
Easy come and easy go
Cut me deep into the bone
You're my perfect getaway
I am right where I belong
We got more than words can say

Baby, I'm a renegade
Baby, you're a firestorm
Move your body close to mine
We can dance into the dawn
I can see we're getting late
The way you, the way you, the way you look tonight
And I could lose a year of sleep

The way you, the way you, the way you look tonight

Kane Brown - Found You Lyrics

I'd be sitting in the same old bar
Heart breaking on a broken bar stool
Wishing she'd come running back
Running from the past
Runnin up the tab drinkin for two
But that night my boys showed up
Dragged me out on the town, had to pick me up
I'd never know what I was missin' if they didn't

'Cause I'd never found you
At that random house party that I didn't even wanna go to
The way you move
Had me first time feelin' in a while I should make one too
Sometimes the finish line is just the start of something new
If I'd never lost her
Then I'd never found you
Then I'd never found you
Never found you

Yes to go out sometimes
But I don't never try to get that drunk
Now I can't even sleep because you're all over me
And all night keeping me up
Yeah you talk to believe that a goodbye could be
So good to me

No I'd never found you
At that random house party that I didn't even wanna go to
They way you move
Had me first time feelin' in a while I should make one too
Sometimes the finish line is just the start of something new
If I'd never lost her
Then I'd never found you
Oh I'd never found you
Uhmm, I'd never found you

And now I'm taking back the way I said I wish I've never met
Sometimes the things that don't work out
Couldn't work out any better

I'd never found you
No, I'd never found you

'Cause I'd never found you
At that random house party that I didn't even wanna go to
They way you move
Had me first time feelin' in a while I should make one too
Sometimes the finish line is just the start of something new
If I'd never lost her
Then I'd never found you
I'd never found you
Never found, never found you
Oh I'd never found you

Michael Ray - Get To You Lyrics

Get To You

l

Somebody had to hurt you bad
For you to give up like that
Somebody had to break your heart in two
But that ain't me and you
So tell me why, tell me why, tell me why
You can't look me in the eye
What am I supposed to do?
When you say we're through
Why do you?

Run away, run away from love
What the hell are you so scared of?
You walk away when you've had enough
Of trying, of trying
Girl there's always gonna be some pain
A little sunshine, a little rain
It doesn't mean it ain't worth it babe
I'm trying, I'm trying to get to you
To you

One day you're gonna love again
Mess up and let somebody in
To every part of your whole world
You think it's unthinkable girl
But somebody's gonna break those walls
Somebody's gonna watch you fall
Gonna give it your all and I hope that I'm around
When you finally find out why you

Run away, run away from love
What the hell are you so scared of?
You walk away when you've had enough
Of trying, of trying
Girl there's always gonna be some pain
A little sunshine, a little rain
It doesn't mean it ain't worth it babe
I'm trying, I'm trying to get to you
To you

So tell me why, tell me why, tell me why
You can't look me in the eye
What am I supposed to do?
When you say we're through
Why do you?

Run away, run away from love
What the hell are you so scared of?
You walk away when you've had enough
Of trying, of trying
Girl there's always gonna be some pain
A little sunshine, a little rain
It doesn't mean it ain't worth it babe
I'm trying, I'm trying to get to you
To you

Somebody had to hurt you bad
For you to give up like that
Somebody had to break your heart in two
But that ain't me and you

Cole Swindell Lyrics - Stay Downtown


When I feel my phone buzzing, ain't even gotta look down
I know it's you that's calling, a couple drinks in by now
So I say, "Hello," you say, "Hey, babe"
Say you're 'bout to catch a cab over to my place
"See you in five," but, baby, this time

Stay downtown
Keep moving your heels on the floor
Let the bartender pour you up another round
Tip the cover band, find another hand
To dance and call him your rebound
Another late night love, another last call crush
With the neon shining down
Girl, this time around, stay downtown

Ain't gonna lie, if you knock on my door
I'm gonna let you walk in
Let you leave drunk lipstick marks like tattoos on my skin
But you know in the morning
We're gonna regret everything we did
So why even start what ain't good for our parts

Stay downtown
Keep moving your heels on the floor
Let the bartender pour you up another round
Tip the cover band, find another hand
To dance and call him your rebound
Another late night love, another last call crush
With the neon shining down
Girl, this time around, stay downtown

Keep sipping your drink, keep spinning the room
Keep chasing the night like you always do
Keep letting gate good times play
Don't let me get in your way

Stay downtown
Keep moving your heels on the floor
Let the bartender pour you up another round
Tip the cover band, find another hand
To dance and call him your rebound
Another late night love, another last call crush
With the neon shining down
Girl, this time around, stay downtown
Stay downtown
Yeah, this time around, baby, stay downtown

Lady Antebellum - Heart Break Lyrics

I paint my lips red, I turn my own head
Don't need nobody's help, zipping up my own dress
Pay my own tab, with my own cash, unattached
Sometimes the world alone, sounds like a sad song
Why's it gotta be, cause what I really need is a reset
And a deep breath, yeah

I think it's time to take a heart break, out late
Solo on a saturday night
Going out without a plus one, I'm done
Falling over pickup lines
I'm single for the summer, I won't rebound
One lover to another, or be tied down
I'm sleeping like a queen in a california king I made (I made, I made)
I think it's time to take a heart break
I think it's time to take a heart break

It's just a little phase, give me a little space
You might see through it, but I'm putting on a poker face
Give a love a rest, between my ex, and my next

I think it's time to take a heart break, out late
Solo on a saturday night
Going out without a plus one, I'm done
Falling over pickup lines
I'm single for the summer, I won't rebound
One lover to another, or be tied down
'Til I'm sleeping like a queen in a California king I made (I made, I made)
I think it's time to take a heart break
I think it's time to take a heart break

Love, I'm over you (love, I'm over you)
It's long overdue
I think it's time to take a heart break (I'm single for the summer, I won't rebound)
I think it's time to take a heart break

I think it's time to take a heart break, out late
Solo on a saturday night
Going out without a plus one, I'm done
Falling over pickup lines
I'm single for the summer, I won't rebound
One lover to another, or be tied down
'Til I'm sleeping like a queen in a california king I made (I made, I made)
I think it's time to take a heart break
I think it's time to take a heart break

Appreciate the call
Means a lot and all
Yeah, I've got a minute
You and me can talk about anything you want
A long as she ain't in it
Say, it's been at least a month
Since I've had any fun, buddy, I'll admit it
Yeah, but I remember going out
Think I'm ready for a crowd
As long as she ain't in it
Don't wanna her her name, don't wanna see her face I swear
I know it's gonna hurt if I run into her somewhere
Yeah, we can hit that place down by the interstate
Out past the city limits
Hang out all night long, hear a country song
As long as she ain't in it
Don't wanna hear her name
Don't wanna see her face, I swear
I know it's gonna hurt if I run into her somewhere
Yeah, I can drink and I can dance
I can party, I can laugh
But no matter how you spin it
Everything has changed
My life won't be the same
As long as she ain't in it
As long as she ain't in it

It was a Friday night
No cover but the cover band was soundin right
And there you were
Just flirty dancin by the neon sign
To fishin in the dark
You were reelin in my heart
Now look at where we are

I'm hooked on kissin you gettin
Gettin you turned on
Buzzin and lovin on you
All night long
Like a hit song
On the radio
You already know
The way it goes
All it took was a look
And I was hooked on
The way that you're takin
Takin my shirt off
And runnin my fingers through your
Long blonde hair fallin in your eyes
Like the first time they caught mine
All it took was a look and I was hooked

It's Saturday
You're still asleep and I could leave
But no way
This ain't a one night thing kinda thing
I wanna wake you up
I wanna press my luck
Land my lips on your cheek
Like I can't get enough

Cause I'm hooked on kissin you gettin
Gettin you turned on
Buzzin and lovin on you
All night long
Like a hit song
On the radio
You already know
The way it goes
All it took was a look
And I was hooked on
The way that you're takin
Takin my shirt off
And runnin my fingers through your
Long blonde hair fallin in your eyes
Like the first time they caught mine
All it took was a look and I was hooked

You got me hooked on kissin you gettin
Gettin you turned on
Buzzin and lovin on you
All night long
Like a hit song

All it took was a look
And I was hooked on
The way that you're takin
Takin my shirt off
And runnin my fingers through your
Long blonde hair fallin in your eyes
Like the first time they caught mine
All it took was a look and I was hooked

Little Big Town - When Someone Stops Loving You Lyrics

Still gotta walk into a crowded room
With a radio on
Crack a smile and crack beer like it don't bother you
Like it ain't you're song that's on
Still gotta cross the bridge to get to work
The one by her place
Make it through the 9 to 5 like it don't hurt
It goes that way

When someone stops loving you
It don't make the evening news
It don't keep the sun from rising
The clock from winding
Your heart from beating
Even when you want it to
When someone stops loving you

Still gotta button up your collared shirt
The one she used to button down
Sleep on the mattress where her body left a curve
Or maybe just the couch
Still gotta keep her number in your phone
In case she calls back one night when she's drunk and all alone
Yeah, your praying for that

When someone stops loving you
It don't make the evening news
It don't keep the sun from rising
The clock from winding
Your heart from beating
Even when you want it to
When someone stops loving you

The hardest part about it is there ain't a switch that you can flip
Cause you can't stop loving them

When someone stops loving you
When someone stops loving you

It don't keep the sun from rising
The clock from winding
Your heart from beating
Even when you want it to
When someone stops loving you

When someone stops loving you
When someone stops loving you

Luke Combs - One Number Away Lyrics

Are you sitting at home all alone trying to fall asleep?
Are you staring a hole through your phone praying that it rings?
Are you watching a movie that you've seen a thousand times?
Maybe playing some Mayer getting lost in your favorite lines?

If you're anything like me
You just might be doing whatever it takes to drown out the noise
But I just wanna hear your voice

And I'm one number away from calling to you
I said I was through, but I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess, girl I confess
I lied when I said, "I'm leaving and not coming back"
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go I see your face
In my brain, dial it up, everything I want to say
But I'm still one number away

Are you stuck at a red light with a Marlboro Light on your lips?
Does the smoke in your mirror get clearer without my kiss?
Are you changing the station replacing our favorite song?
Maybe it's a mistake, hit the brakes, I'm moving on

If you're anything like me
You just might be doing whatever it takes to outrun the storm
But I'm almost out that door

And I'm one number away from calling to you
I said I was through, but I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess, girl, I confess
I lied when I said, "I'm leaving and not coming back"
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go I see your face
In my brain, dial it up, everything I want to say
But I'm still one number away

Will you pick up when I call?
Or just forget we loved at all?
We don't have to talk, I just wanna hear your voice

And I'm one number away from calling to you
I said I was through, but I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess, girl, I confess
I lied when I said, "I'm leaving and not coming back"
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go I see your face
In my brain, dial it up, anything I want to say
But I'm still one number away
Away
Away
Yea I'm still one number away

Chris Janson - Drunk Girl Lyrics

Chris Janson Lyrics - Drunk Girl


Couple of cover charge stamps got her hand looking like a rainbow
In and out of every bar on a whim just like the wind blows
She's either a bachelorette or coming off a breakup
Take a drunk girl home

She's bouncing like a pinball
Singing every word she never knew
Dancing with her eyes closed like she's the only one in the room
Her hairs a perfect mess, falling out of that dress
Take a drunk girl home

Take a drunk girl home
Let her sleep all alone
Leave her keys on the counter your number by her phone
Pick up her life she threw on the floor
Leave the hall lights on walk out and lock the door
That's how she knows the difference between a boy and man
Take a drunk girl home

You leave her drive for a dive
You get something bad to eat
They're singing closing time at that little bar across the street
Then two by two strangers and lovers headed for the covers hooking up
That TV in your two bedroom sounds turned off
Through the paper thin walls you can hear the neighbor's cigarette cough
There's a million things you could be doing, but there's one thing you're damn sure glad you did

Take a drunk girl home
Let her sleep all alone
Leave her keys on the counter your number by the phone
Pick up her life she threw on the floor
Leave the hall lights on walk out and lock the door
That's how you know the difference in a boy and man
Take a drunk girl home

Took a drunk girl home
In the sober light of dawn
She left you a message she thanked you on the phone
Cause you picked up her life she threw on the floor
You left the hall lights on walked out and locked the door
That's how she knows the difference between a boy and man
Take a drunk girl home

You took a drunk girl home
Take a drunk girl home

Taylor Swift - New Year's Day Lyrics

[Verse 1]
There's glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me from the night before but

[Chorus]
Don't read the last page
But I stay when you're lost and I'm scared and you're turning away
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

[Verse 2]
You squeeze my hand three times in the back of the taxi
I can tell that it's going to be a long road
I'll be there through the toast of the town babe
Or if you strike out and you're crawling home

[Chorus]
Don't read the last page
But I stay when it's hard or it's wrong or you're making mistakes
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

[Post-Chorus]
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
And I will hold on to you

[Bridge]
Please don't ever become a stranger whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
Please don't ever become a stranger whose laugh I could recognize anywhere

[Verse 3]
There's glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me forevermore

[Chorus]
Don't read the last page
But I stay when it's hard or it's wrong or we're making mistakes
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

[Post-Chorus]
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
And I will hold on to you

[Outro]
Please don't ever become a stranger whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
Please don't ever become a stranger whose laugh I could recognize anywhere

Chris Stapleton - Millionaire Lyrics

They say love is more precious than gold,
It can't be bought and it can't be sold

I got love, enough to spare,
That makes me a millionaire.

I got a woman with eyes that shine,
Down deep as a diamond mine,
She is my treasure so very rare,
She made me a millionaire,
When we ride around,
Ride around this old town in my beat up car
With the windows down,
People look at her and they look at me
And say, "That boy is sure living in luxury; sweet luxury".
Because love is more precious than gold,
It can't be bought, no, never could be sold,
I've got love, enough to share,
That makes me a millionaire,

When the kids are far from everywhere,
Life reaches on,
A millionaire,
When my pockets are empty and my cupboard is bare,
I still feel like a millionaire,
Because love is more precious than gold,
It can't be bought, no and it can't be sold,
I've got love enough to spare,
That makes me a millionaire.

Sugarland - Still The Same Lyrics

Where do we start?
How 'bout right here where we are?
You've been carrying this weight around
Walk in the door and lay it down
Life goes fast
It's been a while, I have to ask
Where have you been? How did that feel?
Where are we now? 'Cause that's what's real, yeah

All the space and the time between us
Man, you should have seen us
This ain't no mystery
Our future is our history

I feel alive
And can we try
To leave it better than how it came
Don't be afraid to change
Our love is still the same, still the same, still the same
And here we are
We've come so far
Let's leave it better than how it came
Don't be afraid to change
Our love is still the same, still the same, still the same

What comes next
We don't know, we're not there yet
But I bet it's gonna shine better than all we left behind
In a room in a blink and now it's
Like we never went a day without it
Pick it back up where we left off
This is liftoff

I feel alive
And can we try
To leave it better than how it came
Don't be afraid to change
Our love is still the same, still the same, still the same
And here we are
We've come so far
Let's leave it better than how it came
Don't be afraid to change
Our love is still the same, still the same, still the same

Ooh ooh, watch it spin
And ooh ooh, jump right in
And ooh ooh, let's begin
And we can see don't have to be
A big step, just imagine
Take a breath, let it happen
When I hear you laugh
It sets me free, it sets me free

I feel alive
And can we try
To leave it better than how it came
Don't be afraid to change
Our love is still the same, still the same, still the same
And here we are
We've come so far
Let's leave it better than how it came
Don't be afraid to change
Our love is still the same, still the same, still the same
I feel alive
And can we try
To leave it better than how it came
Don't be afraid to change
Our love is still the same, still the same, still the same

Kane Brown - What's Mine Is Yours Lyrics

Wasn't really looking when you caught my eyes
Just another town, just another night
Didn't say much, I was scared for my life
I didn't catch your number and didn't know your name
Tried to move on, couldn't help to think of you
And I knew that you'd change everything

What's mine is yours
Every breathe I take, every choice I make
It might sound crazy
All my pain, washed away, in the blink of an eye
Yeah, you saved me
You got all of me and I don't need it anymore
What's mine is yours
What's mine is yours
What's mine is yours

Now there's make up my counter
Your shoes on my floor
Taking my side of the bed and more
But it's fine, cause you changed everything

What's mine is yours
Every breathe I take, every choice I make
It might sound crazy
All my pain, washed away, in the blink of an eye
Yeah, you saved me
You got all of me and I don't need it anymore
What's mine is yours
What's mine is yours
Yeah, yeah

Take this ring
Forever now
Til death do us apart
And take this vow

What's mine is yours
Every breathe I take, every choice I make
It might sound crazy
All my pain, washed away, in the blink of an eye
What's mine is yours
Every breathe I take, every choice I make
It might sound crazy
All my pain, washed away, in the blink of an eye
Yeah, you saved me
You got all of me and I don't need it anymore
What's mine is yours
What's mine is yours
Yeah, yeah
